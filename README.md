## A Mechanism That Calculates The Coefficients Of Friction Between Two Surfaces(Yes, both static and kinetic coefficients!)  
  
Honestly, I couldn't find this mechanism a better name. So we call it the "friction mechanism" throughout the readme.

## Physics Behind This Project

The Î¸ is the angle between the inclined surface and the horizontal surface when the object starts to slide.

## Usage  
  
You can download this repository and run the code in your system by the following commands.
  
```
git clone https://github.com/GodOfKebab/Friction-Coefficient-Calculating-Mechanism
cd Friction-Coefficient-Calculating-Mechanism/Codes
python3 main.py [mode]
```

There is only one python program named "main.py". However, to run it, you also need to specify the mode: "static" or "kinetic".
This mode determines which coefficient of friction you want to find out.
